We're currently in private beta. By making it available to larger public, we want to learn about various workflows and create a much better product.

 We want to deliver best possible experience but here are few things to keep in mind.


## Guidelines

- Current usage doesn't have any limit on testing. People in private beta will receive special discount :D.

- Please don't exploit the system. We run pool of super computers to make testing easy. Any undesirable DDoS or exploit will attract a ban.

- We can't guaranteed uptime during private beta. While we're learning more about different workflows, system might get disrupted.

## Future pricing

During the initial private beta Crusher Cloud the service is free to use. Once Crusher Cloud reaches General Availablity, detailed pricing will be announced.

Keep in mind, these pricing will just not provide you infra but an integrated system.
