Crusher support no-code recording for test. Most primitive actions are recorded by defauly, it's like magic in air.

Just open crusher recorder, brorwse website and voila!!.

Crusher has an auto-detect feature, recording actions performed by you during the recording, allowing you to create tests with clarity and accuracy.

Actions are classified into:- <br/>
1) Page-Level Actions <br/>
2) Element Level Actions

## Page-Level Actions

Every action without involving a specific element would come under
this category.

### Taking A screenshot of the page
![Taking screenshot of page](https://i.imgur.com/bYS2QlE.png)

You can add a visual regression check to the whole
page. Tests passing and failing will depend on if anything on this page
has changed visually.

### Asserting SEO tags on a page
![Adding seo assertions on page](https://i.imgur.com/6irfSAz.png)

You can set up assertions for all the SEO-relevant tags like `title`, `description`.

There are three ways to add an assertion,
- Matches: Strict check to make sure the value matches the text.
- Contains: Check to make sure the value contains the specified text
- Regex: Make sure the value matches the regex pattern

**Note**: You can also use `Generate Checks`, which will create a check of all the information related to the element.

### Waiting for x seconds

Actions like waiting for the loader to resolve or waiting for a time-sensitive task from your website to finish, you can use this action to wait for the specified seconds.
**Note**: Value should be in `seconds`
### Add custom code for complex use cases.

With this action, you can extend the functionality of the recorder/runner and add your own
custom implementation (e.g- setting cookies, db assertions over API, etc.) of actions according to
your use-case.

For more detailed information, check out the `Custom Actions` docs.

Element Mode

## Element Level Actions

Every action directly related to an element will fall under this category. Elements actions are recorded by default, so you don't have to record themseparately.



**Note**: For recorder steps, we automatically record all the previous relevant actions. Checkout `Auto hover` doc for more information

**Note**: To add an element-level action, you'll first have to select an element on the
targeted site. Check out the `Creating your first test` doc on how to do that.

### Click
**(Supports auto-recording)**
![Click on element](https://i.imgur.com/CgDpdHC.png)

This will perform click on the selected element and record it as a step of your test.
### Hover
**(Supports auto-recording)**
![Record hover](https://i.imgur.com/wTLlEmE.png)

Performs hover on the selected element and record it as a step.

Crusher automatically records relevant hovers, we select relevant hovers across async mutation boundaries.  Auto hover is quite stable, if this breaks in some cases get in touch with us.

A two-level dropdown is an example of one such situation.

Checkout the `Auto Hover` doc for more information regarding this.

### Screenshot
![Take element screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/yUIObt0.png)

Take a screenshot of the selected element. This is useful when you want to run visual checks on a particular element.

### Element assertions
![Element Assertions](https://i.imgur.com/k6L8I2u.png)
This action will allow you to add assertion over the selected element attributes and content it has (`innerHTML`, `innerText`).

There are 3 types to add assertion,
- Matches: Strict check to make sure the value matches what is specified.
- Contains: Check to make sure the value contains the text
- Regex: Check to make sure the value matches the regex pattern

**Note**: You can also use `Generate Checks`, which will create a check of all the information related to the element.

### Add Input
(Recorded Automatically)

Input actions are detected automatically, as you navigate the site when recording the test.

### Custom Assertion
![Add custom element assertion](https://i.imgur.com/S6yWYp8.png)

This action allows you to add custom assertion logic for an element.
You can add custom code for edge cases. In the end, you should be returning true and false. `element` reference is passed in the function argument, which you can use to write your assertion logic.

If the function returns `true`, it means the assertion has passed<br/>
And If the function returns `false`, it means the assertion has failed
