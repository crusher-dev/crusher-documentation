description: List of actions available when creating tests.

One of the main features of crusher is its ability to auto-detect
all the actions performed by you during recording phase, giving you the ability to create your 
tests with much more clarity and accuracy.

Broadly the crusher actions are classified into two categories:- <br/>
1) Page Level Actions <br/>
2) Element Level Actions

## Page Level Actions

Generally every action unrelated to a specific element on the page would come under
this category, including writing custom actions using code.

### Taking screenshot of page
![Taking screenshot of page](https://i.imgur.com/bYS2QlE.png)

With this action, you can add a visual regression check to the whole
page. Tests will pass and fail depending on if any thing on this page
has changed visually.

### Asserting SEO tags on page
![Adding seo assertions on page](https://i.imgur.com/6irfSAz.png)

This action is useful in making sure your site is always in excellant SEO
condition. With this action, you can setup assertions for all the seo relevant
tags including `title`.

There are 3 types of ways in which you can add an assertion,
- Matches: Strict check to make sure the value matches exactly as what is specified.
- Contains: Check to make sure the value contains the specified text
- Regex: Check to make sure the value mathces the regex pattern

**Note**: You can also use `Generate Checks`, which will create check of all the information related to the element.

### Waiting for x seconds

Weather it be waiting for loader to resolve or waiting for a time sensitive
task from your website to finish, you can use this action to wait for the specified
seconds.

**Note**: The value must be specified in `seconds`
### Adding custom code for complex bits.

With this action, you can extend the functionality of crusher and add your own
custom implementation (e.g setting cookies, db assertions over API, etc.,) of actions according to
your use-case.

For more detailed information, checkout the `Custom Actions` docs.

## Element Level Actions

Every action directly related to an element will fall under this category. Some of the actions under
this category are recording automatically by default, so you don't have to explicity record them
sperately.

**Note**: Every element action that is recorded, automatically records all the relevant hover actions on elements
if they have somehow affected the element. Checkout `Auto hover` doc for more information

**Note**: To add an element level action, you'll first have to select an element on the
targeted site. Checkout `Creating your first test` doc on how to do that.

### Click
**(Supports auto recording)**

This will perform click on the selected element and record it as a step of your test.
### Hover
**(Supports auto recording)**

This will perform hover on the selected element and record it as a step.

If however the selected element, is hover-dependent on
any other element on the page (i.e hovering on some other element has affected the selected element) then all
the hover dependencies will be recorded automatically as hover actions. A two level dropdown is a perfact example of one such situation.

Checkout the `Auto Hover` doc for more information regarding this.

### Screenshot

This will add a step in your test to take screenshot of the selected element. This is useful
when you want to run visual checks on a particular element.

### Element assertions
![Element Assertions](https://i.imgur.com/k6L8I2u.png)
This action will allow you to add assertion over the selected element atrributes and content it has (`innerHTML`, `innerText`).

There are 3 types of ways in which you can add an assertion,
- Matches: Strict check to make sure the value matches exactly as what is specified.
- Contains: Check to make sure the value contains the specified text
- Regex: Check to make sure the value mathces the regex pattern

**Note**: You can also use `Generate Checks`, which will create check of all the information related to the element.

### Add Input
(Recorded Automatically)

Input actions are recorded automatically, as you navigate the site when recording the test.

### Custom Assertion
![Add custom element assertion](https://i.imgur.com/S6yWYp8.png)

This action allows you to add custom assertion logic for an element. This is done by writing an custom code
which returns true or false. `element` reference is passed as the function argument, which you can use to
write your assertion logic.

If the function returns `true`, it means the assertion has passed<br/>
And If the function returns `false`, it means the assertion has falled

    h3 {
        color: rgb(220 220 220 / 70%) !important;
    }
