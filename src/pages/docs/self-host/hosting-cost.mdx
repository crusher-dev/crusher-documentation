## AWS - 65$/month

As of now, we suggest the default setup.

1.) T3.large instance ~= 60.81$

- These are burstable instance, if your usage are high, then you should go with c3.large $73.

- If you reserve instance for 1 year, you get 40% discount ~= 36$/month

2.) 45GB of EBS storage ~= 3.6$



> With 65$/month you can run 1 parallel test. Which is way cheaper than any other
> testing solution out there.
